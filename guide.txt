## 🎨 Advanced Features

### Combining Multiple Tools

The agent can use multiple tools in sequence:

**Example:**
```
Query: "Research neural networks and compare with my project documentation"

Agent Process:
1. Uses ArXiv → Finds papers
2. Uses Knowledge_Base → Reads your docs
3. Uses LLM → Compares and synthesizes
4. Returns comprehensive answer
```

### Tool Chaining

**Example:**
```
Query: "Find the highest paid department and explain their typical roles"

Agent Process:
1. Database_Query → "SELECT department, MAX(AVG(salary))..."
2. Web_Search → Search for "[department] roles and responsibilities"
3. Combines results
```

---

## 🔍 Query Patterns

### Effective Query Patterns

**✅ Good Queries:**
```
"Search for latest AI developments"
"What does Wikipedia say about Einstein?"
"Find ArXiv papers on transformers"
"SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 80000"
"Read file data/report.txt"
"What skills are in my uploaded resume?"
```

**❌ Ineffective Queries:**
```
"Search" (too vague)
"Find stuff" (unclear intent)
"Database" (missing query)
"File" (missing file path)
```

### Query Keywords

**For Web Search:**
- "search", "latest", "current", "news", "today"

**For Wikipedia:**
- "explain", "what is", "tell me about", "define"

**For ArXiv:**
- "papers", "research", "study", "publication"

**For Database:**
- "SELECT", "employees", "projects", "show", "list"

**For File Reader:**
- "read", "file", "open", "content of"

**For Knowledge Base:**
- "my document", "uploaded", "according to", "in my resume"

## 📈 Performance Tips

### Optimize Query Speed

1. **Be Specific:** Clear queries = faster results
2. **Use Right Tool:** Help agent by being explicit
3. **Limit Scope:** Ask focused questions
4. **Upload Small Docs:** < 5MB for faster processing

### Best Practices

```
✅ "Search web for latest Python 3.12 features"
   (Specific tool + clear intent)

✅ "SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department='Engineering'"
   (Exact SQL query)

✅ "Find ArXiv papers published in 2024 about LLMs"
   (Specific timeframe + topic)

❌ "Tell me about programming"
   (Too broad, agent may struggle)
```
